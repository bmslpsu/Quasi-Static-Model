# Quasi-Static-Model
Quasi Static model evolved from "Quasi-Static-Integrative-Model"

Forces are correct but torques need debugging

How to Run:
There are 3 main files depending on what you want to do.
1. Analyis_Robot: This lets you run one cycle of a robot based on the wing changes you want (This is most useful for torque debugging)
2. Main_Code_Robot: This lets you run multiple perturbations in the wing and runs in batches
3. Main_Code_Fly: This pulls directly from the kinematics of the real flies.
